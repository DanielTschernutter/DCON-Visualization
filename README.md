# DCON Benchmarking Visualization
#### A Globally Convergent Algorithm for Neural Network Parameter Optimization Based on Difference-of-Convex Functions

This package uses the implemantation of the DCON algorithm as introduced in
> D. Tschernutter, M. Kraus, S. Feuerriegel (2022). A Globally Convergent Algorithm for Neural Network Parameter Optimization Based on Difference-of-Convex Functions. Working Paper

The package can be downloaded from
https://github.com/DanielTschernutter/DCON
and installed via
```
pip install .
```

#### Instructions

1. Install the DCON package as described above.

2. Download the repository and run
    ```
    pip install .
    ```

3. The visualization tool can then be opened via
    ```
    run DCON_Visualization
    ```
